# Hospital_Network_design
In this project we will primarily focus on the network proposal designed
for a Hospital. A hospital management software is of utmost necessity in
a hospital as the efficient flow of orders and instructions need to be taken
to not only work efficiently but also save peopleâ€™s lives. In this network
topology the nodes (i.e., computers, switches, routers or other devices)
are connected to a local area network (LAN) and network via links
(twisted pair copper wire cable or optical fiber cable). We have used
Cisco Packet Tracer for designing the network topology. It is a general
design which can be implemented at any higher level to manage
network systems.
